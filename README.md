# WindowsCommandPrompt (.NET) by fybalaban
 A full-feature wrapper for the Microsoft Windows Command Prompt. Control the cmd.exe only with a RichTextBox.
 
 There isn't any reliable solution to control the cmd.exe in a Winforms application, so I made one for everyone!
 Base logic of the code is from ConsoleControlAPI, but I changed almost everything. Bugs with the inputting is now fixed.
 Also check out the ConsoleControlAPI: https://github.com/dwmkerr/consolecontrol/
 
 * Targeted .NET Framework version is 4.6
